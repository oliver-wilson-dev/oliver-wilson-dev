# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I'm Oliver Wilson, a Web Developer from the UK.

Normally people put lots of interesting facts and information in their GitHub profile readme, but I've already built my own [personal website](https://oliverwilson.dev/) where you can find loads of information about myself, my educational background, my work experience and the cool projects that I've worked on; so as a true software engineer, I am going to be DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and keep those details in one place.

Please check out my personal website [www.oliverwilson.dev](https://oliverwilson.dev/) ðŸ™‚.
